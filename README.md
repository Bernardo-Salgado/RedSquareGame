Klotski Game Solver
A Python implementation of the classic Klotski puzzle game, featuring multiple solving algorithms like BFS, DFS, IDS, and A*. The game can be played manually or solved using the provided solvers, with visualization and a graphical interface built using Pygame.

Requirements (to install):

python3
pygame
random
heapq
time
